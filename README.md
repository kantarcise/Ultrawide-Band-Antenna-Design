HFSS is fun =)


## Introduction

This project started off as a UWB design, but turned to a little disaster. Hopefully saved with a little tweak at the end though.

First off all, the reference design was [this paper from IJRTE.](https://www.ijrte.org/wp-content/uploads/papers/v8i1/A1959058119.pdf) 
This design claimed a simulation for a dual band patch antenna, with a kinda basic geometry. Only 2 slots were taken out of the regular 
patch shape, and a generic feeding line structure.

But boy i was wrong.

## Help, I don't understand this!
